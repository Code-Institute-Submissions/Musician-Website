# Joe Bloggs Music

Joe Bloggs Music is a Milestone Project created for the "User Centric Development"
module of my FullStack Software Development Course offered by Code Institute.

The website is for a fictional musician named Joe Bloggs based in the city of Galway.
The website is to advertise upcoming shows, promote the artist, and also give the option to
make a booking.

## UX

The purpose of the site is to promote the work of the Artist. This is done by showcasing photos and 
testimonials, and advertising upcoming shows. The function to book the artist via the website is included.

The website is simple and structured in a way that is easy and intuitive to navigate through.

### User Stories
* As a user I want to find out the date and location of upcoming gigs. 
* As a user I also want to be able to navagate through photos and and navagate to the artists social media pages. 
* As a user I would also like to enquire about booking the artist.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
## Deployment

1. I uploaded all files to my Github repository located at this url; https://github.com/Daniel-Slattery/Musician-Website which is for this individual project.

2. To publish the project to see it working as a live website, I published the master branch of my 
Github repository using Github Pages.
