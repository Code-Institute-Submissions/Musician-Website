# Joe Bloggs Music

Joe Bloggs Music is a Milestone Project created for the "User Centric Development"
module of my FullStack Software Development Course offered by Code Institute.

The website is for a fictional musician named Joe Bloggs based in the city of Galway.
The website is to advertise upcoming shows, promote the artist, and also give the option to
make a booking.
