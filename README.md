# Joe Bloggs Music

Joe Bloggs Music is a Milestone Project created for the "User Centric Development"
module of my FullStack Software Development Course offered by Code Institute.

The website is for a hypothethical musician named Joe Bloggs based in the city of Galway.
The website is to advertise upcoming shows, promote the artist, and also give the option to
make a booking.

## UX

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, 
what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, 
with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you 
created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file 
in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format 
that is viewable inside the browser.
