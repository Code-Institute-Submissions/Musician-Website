# Joe Bloggs Music

Joe Bloggs Music is a Milestone Project created for the "User Centric Development"
module of my FullStack Software Development Course offered by Code Institute.

The website is for a fictional musician named Joe Bloggs based in the city of Galway.
The website is to advertise upcoming shows, promote the artist, and also give the option to
make a booking.

## UX

The purpose of the site is to promote the work of the Artist. This is done by showcasing photos and 
testimonials, and advertising upcoming shows. The function to book the artist via the website is included.

The website is simple and structured in a way that is easy and intuitive to navigate through.

### User Stories
